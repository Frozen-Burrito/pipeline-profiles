      <p>As part of the CER’s environmental protection activities, we require
        companies to manage and remediate contamination throughout the lifecycle
        of the facilities. As a first step, regulated companies are required to
        report contamination to the CER through the online submission of the
        Notification of Contamination (NOC).</p>
      <p>After the NOC is submitted, companies must demonstrate they are
        actively managing the contamination according to the
        <a
          href="https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/safety-environment/environment/remediation/remediation-process-guide-2020/index.html"
          target="_blank"
        >Remediation Process Guide</a>. The progress of remediation at the
        contaminated site, and its current status, are captured in the annual
        update submitted by a company each year for a contaminated site.
      </p>
      <p>Third-party contamination is on-site contamination that is shown to not
        be emanating or migrating from the company’s facilities or company-owned
        or leased lands or Right-of-Way. While third-party contamination is not
        the result of company activities, the CER still requires that this
        contamination is reported to the CER through the submission of the NOC.</p>
      <p>The dashboard below contains information that is contained in the NOC's
        and annual updates found in REGDOCS. The CER publishes NOCs that have
        been submitted to the CER since August 2018, when the CER started
        collecting this information electronically and annual updates that have
        been submitted since 2021. For information on contaminated sites for
        which NOCs were submitted prior to August 2018, email
        <a

        <p>Contaminated sites must be remediated, which can be accomplished in
        several ways. Contaminated soil may be dug up and removed from the site
        to be disposed of, and contaminated groundwater could be extracted and
        treated to remove contaminants.
        <i>Note: I want to conclude this section with a more tangible
          description of what is actually done to achieve remediation. This isnt
          really included in the process guide, but a description of this would
          make it more "real" for our audience. People will want to know what
          the CER/company is doing about all the contaminated soil.</i>
